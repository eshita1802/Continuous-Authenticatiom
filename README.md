# Continuous-Authentication based on Activity Patterns using Mobile Sensing Data
This project focuses on the development of a deep learning-based continuous authentication system using activity patterns derived from smartphone sensing data. Continuous authentication plays a critical role in enhancing security on mobile devices by ensuring that the user is continuously verified on their device. 
The dataset used in this study consists of accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer and linear acceleration data, with a preprocessing pipeline involving normalization, segmentation, and labeling of the activity data using a sliding window approach. 
Initially, several deep learning models, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), were explored; however, due to the complexity of the dataset, these models were discarded. Subsequently, a BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model was adopted, leveraging its strength in handling sequential and time-series data. The performance of the BERT model was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This research demonstrates the potential of transformer-based models in addressing complex authentication tasks and highlights their applicability in the domain of mobile security
